# Cloud Homelab: Kubernetes Cluster (with kubeadm) on AWS 

## Description

This project sets up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using `kubeadm`, as part of my hands-on journey to deepen my cloud-native and DevOps skills. After completing [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/hoaraujerome/kubernetes-the-hard-way-on-aws) to understand the internals, I built this homelab environment to prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam and eventually host real-world workloads.

The infrastructure is provisioned using `Terraform`, and custom AMI for the control plane and worker nodes are built with `Packer` and `Ansible`. Nodes are deployed in private subnet, and I use `EC2 Instance Connect` for secure SSH access. For container networking, I chose `Cilium` as the CNI plugin to explore modern, eBPF-powered Kubernetes networking.

While my current job operates 100% in **Azure**, I deliberately chose **AWS** for this project to strengthen my **multi-cloud proficiency** and broaden my cloud engineering expertise.

I believe the best way to learn is to **get your hands dirty** â€” and this repo is a reflection of that mindset: learning by building, breaking, and improving.

To streamline development and ensure consistent tooling across environments, I use Devbox to manage the developer setup.

## Installation

### Requirements

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox)

### Steps

1. Initialize the environment:

   ```sh
   devbox init
   ```

2. Start the environment:

   ```sh
   devbox shell
   ```
      
3. Setup foundations:
   ```sh
   make foundations
   ```
   
```mermaid
graph TD
    root[Setup Foundations]
    terraform_backend_ami[Terraform Backend for AMI Building]
    terraform_backend_cluster[Terraform Backend for K8S Cluster]
    terraform_sp[Terraform Service Principal]

    root --> terraform_backend_ami
    root --> terraform_backend_cluster
    root --> terraform_sp

    terraform_backend_ami --> create_s3_bucket_ami[S3 Bucket for AMI Building]
    terraform_backend_cluster --> create_s3_bucket_cluster[S3 Bucket for K8S Cluster]

    terraform_sp --> create_iam_user[IAM User]
    terraform_sp --> create_iam_policy[IAM Policy]
    create_iam_user --> attach_iam_user_policy[Attach Policy to User]
    create_iam_policy --> attach_iam_user_policy[Attach Policy to User]
```

4. Build the Kubeadm Base AMI Provision:
   ```sh
   make images-config-build
   # skipping tests flag available: SKIP_TESTS="1" make images-config-build
   ```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Z["Provision ephemeral infrastructure with Terraform"]:::highlight --> A;

    subgraph "For each child module"
        A["Linting & Formatting"] --> B["Unit test"];
        B --> C["Contract test"];
        C --> D["Integration test"];
    end

    D --> Y["Execution plan"];
    Y --> E["Security Scanner"];
    E --> F["Linting & Formatting (root module)"];
    F --> X["Apply plan"];
    X --> G["Publish Kubeadm Base AMI with Packer and Ansible"]:::highlight;
    G --> H["Linting & Formatting"];
    H --> I["Build AMI with K8S Node Playbook"];
    I --> W["Deprovision infrastructure"]:::highlight;

    %% Style for the highlighted root node
    classDef highlight fill:#facc15,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2,color:#000;
    %% Yellow fill, black border/text â€“ good for both light & dark themes
```

## Developer Setup

### Requirements

- [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Steps

1. Clone this repo and cd
2. Initialize the dev environment:

   ```sh
   devbox init
   ```

3. Start the dev environment:

   ```sh
   devbox shell
   ```

4. Install `pre-commit` hooks:

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. (Optional) Run pre-commit on all files:

   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## Usage

* SSH to an EC2 instance

   ```sh
   AWS_PROFILE="k8s_homelab" aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id i-07eb24daa48842f91 --os-user ubuntu --connection-type eice

   export AWS_PROFILE="k8s_homelab"
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_k8s_homelab ubuntu@i-07eb24daa48842f91 -o ProxyCommand='aws ec2-instance-connect open-tunnel --instance-id i-07eb24daa48842f91'
   ```

TODO: complete with "smoke tests"

## Project Status

âœ… **Phase 1 Completed**

The Kubernetes cluster is successfully deployed on AWS using `kubeadm` and self-managed EC2 instances. This phase included:

- Infrastructure as Code setup for 1 control plane node and 1 worker node
- End-to-end automation: AMI building (Packer + Ansible), infrastructure provisioning (Terraform), and cluster bootstrapping
- Secure access to the Kubernetes API server from the local machine
- Devbox is used to streamline the development environment, making it easier to work consistently across my personal workstations.

ðŸš§ **Phase 2 is planned**, but its scope is yet to be defined.
