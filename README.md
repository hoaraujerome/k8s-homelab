# Cloud Homelab: Kubernetes Cluster (with kubeadm) on AWS 

## Description

This project sets up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using `kubeadm`, as part of my hands-on journey to deepen my cloud-native and DevOps skills. After completing [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/hoaraujerome/kubernetes-the-hard-way-on-aws) to understand the internals, I built this homelab environment to prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam and eventually host real-world workloads.

The infrastructure is provisioned using `Terraform`, and custom AMI for the control plane and worker nodes are built with `Packer` and `Ansible`. Nodes are deployed in private subnet, and I use `EC2 Instance Connect` for secure SSH access. For container networking, I chose `Cilium` as the CNI plugin to explore modern, eBPF-powered Kubernetes networking.

While my current job operates 100% in **Azure**, I deliberately chose **AWS** for this project to strengthen my **multi-cloud proficiency** and broaden my cloud engineering expertise.

I believe the best way to learn is to **get your hands dirty** â€” and this repo is a reflection of that mindset: learning by building, breaking, and improving.

## Developer Setup

### Requirements

- TODO: devbox

### Steps

1. Clone this repo and cd
2. Install `pre-commit` hooks:

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. (Optional) Run pre-commit on all files:

   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## Usage

* SSH to the EC2 instance

   ```sh
   AWS_PROFILE="k8s_homelab" aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id i-07eb24daa48842f91 --os-user ubuntu --connection-type eice

   export AWS_PROFILE="k8s_homelab"
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_k8s_homelab ubuntu@i-07eb24daa48842f91 -o ProxyCommand='aws ec2-instance-connect open-tunnel --instance-id i-07eb24daa48842f91'
   ```
